# OnTheMap
This is my 4th Udacity iOS Developer Project.

This is an app with a map that shows information posted by other Udacity students. The map contains pins that show the location
where other students have reported studying. By tapping on the pin users can see a URL for something the student finds
interesting. The user is able to add their own data by posting a string that can be reverse geocoded to a location, and a URL.
